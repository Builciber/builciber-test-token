# Test-Builciber-Token

Test Builciber Token with symbol tBCB, is a time locked token. It is non-transferable and consequently non-tradeable for a set period of time determined by the deployer. During this lock duration (and of course after), **only** the token deployer is able to transfer the token, but every token holder is able to burn the token if they so wish. Its lock duration is mutable, **only** by the deployer. Ownership of the token contract is transferable.

The token is live on Sepolia [testnet](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0xf345c6dec0b607b6f907b9b3fc7b49b5eb3b89b1?a=0x907f3deb613db7b0a4546b334c8dcc1018b45a88).
